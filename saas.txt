I have contributed effectively to multiple projects, including NexGen, Underwriting POC, GRIP, and E360, by applying strong data science and automation skills. My work involved developing and deploying APIs and machine learning models using Python, FastAPI, and related AI tower technologies to improve productivity and decision-making efficiency. In GRIP and E360, I focused on data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and automation of analytical workflows, which helped deliver more consistent and data-driven outcomes. I also participated in KT and knowledge-sharing sessions, promoting the reuse and refinement of KM practices to reduce performance variability and enhance team capability. Additionally, I actively engaged in cultural and tower-level initiatives, maintaining good HyWo adherence and meeting Infraction standards. Overall, I demonstrated strong technical expertise, teamwork, and a commitment to continuous improvement, contributing positively to both project success and organizational growth.
